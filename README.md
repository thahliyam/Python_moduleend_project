# Python_moduleend_project
This project focuses on performing a comprehensive analysis of employee data from ABC Company using Python. The dataset comprises 458 rows and 9 columns, containing critical information such as employee IDs, names, teams, positions, ages, salaries, and other relevant attributes. The primary goal of this project is to transform raw data into meaningful insights through systematic data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and effective data visualization techniques.

The project begins with data preprocessing, where inconsistencies in the dataset are addressed. Specifically, the "height" column is corrected by replacing invalid or missing values with random numbers between 150 and 180 cm to ensure data integrity. Additionally, data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring uniformity across categorical fields are implemented to prepare the data for analysis.

The analysis phase covers several key areas:

Employee Distribution Across Teams: The dataset is analyzed to determine how employees are distributed among various teams. This includes calculating both the absolute count and the percentage share of employees in each team, providing insights into team sizes and organizational structure.
Position-Based Segregation: Employees are categorized based on their positions within the company to identify the most common roles and understand the hierarchy and role distribution across the organization.
Age Group Analysis: Employees are grouped into predefined age categories to identify the predominant age group within the company. This helps in understanding workforce demographics, which can be valuable for HR planning and talent management strategies.
Salary Expenditure Analysis: The project identifies which teams and positions contribute the most to the companyâ€™s overall salary expenditure. This analysis highlights high-cost departments or roles, aiding in budget planning and resource allocation.
Correlation Between Age and Salary: A statistical analysis is performed to investigate the relationship between employees' ages and their salaries. This includes calculating correlation coefficients and creating scatter plots to visualize any trends or patterns, such as whether experience (indicated by age) impacts compensation.
To effectively communicate the findings, the project employs graphical representations using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots are used to visualize distributions, comparisons, and correlations, making complex data more accessible and easier to interpret.

Finally, a data story is crafted to summarize the key insights, trends, and patterns discovered during the analysis. This narrative highlights important observations, such as dominant teams, popular job roles, significant salary trends, and demographic insights. The project is well-documented in a Jupyter Notebook, with clear explanations, comments, and visualizations to support the analysis. The complete project, including the dataset, code, and detailed documentation, is organized in a GitHub repository for easy access and review. This project not only demonstrates technical proficiency in Python and data analysis but also showcases the ability to derive actionable insights from real-world data.
